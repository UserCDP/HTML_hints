### HTML_hints

This is a repository with answers to some (annoying) issues that I encountered when working with HTML and CSS.

# Positioning

Some browsers have this nasty habbit of having some weird defaults, in this case a weird border around elements that are supposed to be from edge to edge, and start from top.

Solution:
```css
body {
  margin: 0px;
  padding: 0px;
```
